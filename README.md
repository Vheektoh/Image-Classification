# Image Classification in Neural Networks

## About Dataset
  In this notebook, we classified small images from cifar10 dataset in tensorflow 
keras dataset. There are a total of 10 classes in the dataset, which are airplane,
automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, sheep, truck.
So basically, the project covers the same classification done using ANN(Artificial 
Neural Network) and CNN(Convolution Neural Network) and the difference in performance 
was shown, showing CNN as a better classifier for images.

## How do you describe the classification of an image?
  Image classification is the process of categorizing and labeling groups of pixels
or vectors within an image based on specific rules. The categorization law can be
devised using one or more spectral or textural characteristics. The Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN or ConvNet) is a subtype of the Neural Networks that is mainly used for 
applications in image and speech recognition. Its built-in convolutional layer reduces 
the high dimensionality of images without losing its information.
